RUN_ANALYSIS

After running the program run_analysis.R you get 2 dataframes containing a list of collumns 
This documents explains the columns of the two dataframes: 

Dataframe 1:
runanalysis
This dataframe contains mean and standard daviation information about of various functions on a set of test en train data of a movement app on an Galaxy II smartphone

Dataframe 2:
groupbymean
This dataframe contains a summary of all values per subject per activity.


The columns selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 


The columns of the dataframes:

The last 2 columns are:
activity	WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING
, STANDING, LAYING

subject		the number of the person who is doing the activity

The other 86 columns:

In short:
 the column names consits of the next terms:
1)Prefix:
t	Time
f	Frequency

2) Accelaration Component
body	Body movement
gravity	The Gravity component

3)signal source
acc	accelerometer
gyro	gyroscope

4)
jerk	Jerk signals
mag	Magnitude


5)Function:
mean 	Mean
std	Standard Deviation

6)Axis letter:
x	X-axis movement
y	Y-axis movement
z	Z-axis movement
